## Git workflow
### Main branch
No direct pushes, only MR’s are allowed
Production ready, no bugs allowed
### Dev branch
No direct pushes, only MR’s are allowed
Semi-production ready, bugs are allowed but must be fixed before they get pushed to the main prod branch.
### Creating a feature or bugfix branch
If you want to work on a user story you have to create a new branch for it. This branch must be based on the dev branch. You will name the branch the same as the title of the user story in Trello. When you are done working on the user story you must create a merge request back in to dev.
